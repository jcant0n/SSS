# Fast Subsurface Scattering Shader

This repository showcases a Fast Subsurface Scattering shader implementation in HLSL, specifically designed for mobile devices. The shader employs advanced BRDF and Translucency techniques to achieve realistic lighting and material interaction in real-time skin rendering.

## Features

- Real-time Subsurface Scattering optimized for mobile devices
- Utilizes advanced BRDF lighting.
- Approximating Translucency.
- IBL (irradiance diffuse contribution)
- Maintains medium precision to ensure compatibility across devices

## Demo
